# Open Mystery Toolkit

A work-in-progress toolkit for creating Mystery Dungeon games.

## Expected features
- Ability to customize monster data, stats
- Ability to generate dungeons as well as using static maps

## Expected programming languages
- TOML, used to read configurations
- Tera, used for NPC scripts and/or extra scenes
- C++, used for programming the toolkit

## Dependences
- nCine, game engine used for the game

## Building
The game would support CMake in the future, for now I'm using the sln file as it's easier to manage at this time.

## Tested platforms
- Windows with Visual Studio 2019
